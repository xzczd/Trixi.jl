As a preparation, you need to install the script once by running\njulia> using MPI\n\njulia> MPI.install_mpiexecjl(destdir=\"/somewhere/in/your/PATH\")\nThen, to execute Trixi in parallel, execute the following command from your command line:\nmpiexecjl -n 3 julia --threads=1 --project=@. -e 'using Trixi; trixi_include(default_example())'\nRun interactively with tmpi (Linux/MacOS only): If you are on a Linux/macOS system, you have a third option which lets you run Julia in parallel interactively from the REPL. This comes in handy especially during development, as in contrast to the first two options, it allows to reuse the compilation cache and thus facilitates much faster startup times after the first execution. It requires tmux and the OpenMPI library to be installed before, both of which are usually available through a package manager. Once you have installed both tools, you need to configure MPI.jl to use the OpenMPI for your system, which is explained here. Then, you can download and install the tmpi script by executing\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azrael3000/tmpi/master/tmpi -o /somewhere/in/your/PATH/tmpi\nFinally, you can start and control multiple Julia REPLs simultaneously by running\ntmpi 3 julia --threads=1 --project=@.\nThis will start Julia inside tmux three times and multiplexes all commands you enter in one REPL to all other REPLs (try for yourself to understand what it means). If you have no prior experience with tmux, handling the REPL this way feels slightly weird in the beginning. However, there is a lot of documentation for tmux available and once you get the hang of it, developing Trixi in parallel becomes much smoother this way.","category":"page"},{"location":"parallelization/","page":"Parallelization","title":"Parallelization","text":"note: Hybrid parallelism\nIt is possible to combine MPI with shared memory parallelism via threads by starting Julia with more than one thread, e.g. by passing the command line argument julia --threads=2 instead of julia --threads=1 used in the examples above.

To quickly see Trixi in action, default_example() returns the path to an example elixir with a short, two-dimensional problem setup. A list of all example elixirs packaged with Trixi can be obtained by running get_examples(). Alternatively, you can also browse the examples/ subdirectory. If you want to modify one of the elixirs to set up your own simulation, download it to your machine, edit the configuration, and pass the file path to trixi_include(...).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Example:-Running-a-simulation-with-Trixi","page":"Home","title":"Example: Running a simulation with Trixi","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"  <script id=\"asciicast-372987\"\n          src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/372987.js\"\n          async\n          data-cols=100\n          data-rows=48></script>","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"If this produces weird symbols or question marks in the terminal on your system, you are probably using Mac OS with problematic fonts.
